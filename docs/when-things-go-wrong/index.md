# When Things Go Wrong

## Real-Life Examples

Even if something feels like a "failure" in the moment, just know that it's okay and that this happens to *everyone*. No one is blaming you for things that go unexpectedly.

Also keep in mind that you as the organizer will notice things that go "wrong" but most of them no one else will notice at all.
