# Community and Conference Organizer Kit

## About this Kit

The Python Software Community and Conference Organizers Kit is a comprehensive resource developed by members of the Python Software Community to support individuals and groups in organizing Python-related events and fostering local communities. Adapted from materials by PyLadies Global, this kit offers practical guidance for both new and experienced organizers.

## Who this Kit Is For

This kit is designed for anyone who wants to help create any kind of Python-focused meetup. This can mean anything, from a small informal social gathering to a big conference - see the [Event MVP](event-mvp/index.md) section for more examples. A lot of this advice works for any kind of event.

We expect that most of the people reading this document will be pretty inexperienced with community organizing, and maybe even haven't ever attended a community event. That's okay! Our aim is to help you learn how to do this and give you a sense of what you can expect building a community or organizing an event.

And, we hope that experienced organizers will pick up some helpful tips - or if nothing else, find this document useful as a written reference to help organize their thoughts or share with newer organizers.

## Adopting this Kit

This kit was inspired by PyLadies Global.

## Local Context Matters

While reading these documents, keep in mind that the recommendations here are based on what has worked well for organizers in their local communities. Your local culture may have different constraints and preferences, and you are the expert in your area. For example, if these docs suggest WhatsApp and you know folks around you use Telegram instead, trust your knowledge and use Telegram. This goes beyond the technology and tools used - communication styles, community guidelines, and so on, all depend on the folks you're engaging with.
