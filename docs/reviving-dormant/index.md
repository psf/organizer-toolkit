# Reviving a Dormant Community

Communities can go dormant for multiple reasons; the organizer may move or burn out, the venue may no longer be available, a global pandemic makes it impossible for us to meet.

Below are some recommendations for reviving a dormant community.

## Assessing the Current State

- How long ago was the last event?
- Why did events stop happening?
- Are there pre-existing resources (internet domain names? Email server?)? Can you get access to them?

## Defining Goals

## Rebuilding Leadership

## Leverage Partnership
