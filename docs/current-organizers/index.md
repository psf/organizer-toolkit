# Current Community Organizers

## General

Ensure that your community is added to the Python Software Community User Groups [Local User Groups Worldwide](https://wiki.python.org/moin/LocalUserGroups). If you would like to announce a Python related event, please see [Submitting an event to the Python events calendars](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEventsCalendar#Submitting_an_Event).

## Event Hosting

## Websites

## Email

We recommend that all Python software communities have their own general email address (e.g. pythonghana.org). You and your other co-organizers can manage that email address how you'd like (e.g. all co-organizers can log in; all email is forwarded; only one organizer manages it; etc).

It is also good practice to keep personal and community communications separate. You can easily do this if you use the Chrome browser and set up [two separate profiles](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824?hl=en)– one for personal and one for your community.

## Account & Password Management

Please sign up for all accounts related to your Python software community with your designated email address. This is so that handover to a future organizer is a lot smoother, and account recovery is easier. We highly suggest you use a unique password for each account you use. An example is [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/), a password manager (so you don't have to remember every unique password) that allows you to create unique and difficult-to-guess passwords, as well as save them for you.

[LastPass](https://lastpass.com/) also allows you to [share](https://helpdesk.lastpass.com/sharing/) passwords with folks; so you can set up your local Python community Facebook account, then store that password in [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/), and allow your co-organizers to log in with that stored password by sharing it.

## Social Media

You are free and encouraged to use any social media that you'd like (be sure to register the account with your community email address).

X, Instagram, LinkedIn, Mastodon, Facebook, Meetup, Bluesky. Note: For Meetup.com users, the PSF financially hosts worldwide Python Meetups on their Meetup Pro Network as long as certain conditions are met.

### How do I ask the PSF to cover Meetup fees?

The PSF financially hosts worldwide Python Meetups on their [Meetup Pro Network](https://www.meetup.com/pro/python-software-foundation-meetups) as long as 3 conditions are met:

- The Meetup holds at least 2 events per calendar year (virtual or in-person).
- Event content focuses on Python content at least 70% of the time. Content may include adjacent topics, such as networking, basic machine learning, etc.
- The Meetup posts your community Code of Conduct in the About tab of the Meetup page to become and stay eligible for the PSF Meetup Pro network.

Please [submit a grant request from the PSF](https://psfmember.org/grant-proposals/). In order to access the form, you may first have to create a free account on the [psfmember.org](https://psfmember.org/) website. Please send questions to grants@pyfound.org.
