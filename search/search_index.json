Adapted from materials by PyLadies Global, this kit offers practical guidance for both new and experienced organizers. Who this Kit Is For \u00b6 This kit is designed for anyone who wants to help create any kind of Python-focused meetup. This can mean anything, from a small informal social gathering to a big conference - see the Event MVP section for more examples. A lot of this advice works for any kind of event. We expect that most of the people reading this document will be pretty inexperienced with community organizing, and maybe even haven't ever attended a community event. That's okay! Our aim is to help you learn how to do this and give you a sense of what you can expect building a community or organizing an event. And, we hope that experienced organizers will pick up some helpful tips - or if nothing else, find this document useful as a written reference to help organize their thoughts or share with newer organizers. About the Python Software Foundation (The PSF) \u00b6 The Python Software Foundation is an organization devoted to advancing open source technology related to the Python programming language. We support and maintain python.org , The Python Package Index , Python Documentation , and many other services the Python Community relies on. Additionally, we produce and underwrite the PyCon US Conference , the largest annual gathering for the Python community. Stay in touch with the PSF \u00b6 To receive important community news, get help, ask questions: Stay up to date on our Blog Sign up for our Newsletter Help and General Contact Submit Website Bug Python Discord You can follow us on X , Mastodon , Bluesky , and LinkedIn . Adopting this Kit \u00b6 This kit was adopted from the PyLadies Global Kit. Local Context Matters \u00b6 While reading these documents, keep in mind that the recommendations here are based on what has worked well for organizers in their local communities. Your local culture may have different constraints and preferences, and you are the expert in your area. For example, if these docs suggest WhatsApp and you know folks around you use Telegram instead, trust your knowledge and use Telegram. This goes beyond the technology and tools used - communication styles, community guidelines, and so on, all depend on the folks you're engaging with.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#community-and-conference-organizer-kit","text":"","title":"Community and Conference Organizer Kit"},{"location":"#about-this-kit","text":"The Python Software Community and Conference Organizers Kit is a comprehensive resource developed by members of the Python Software Community to support individuals and groups in organizing Python-related events and fostering local communities.

Here are some ways to recognize the signs of burnout, and ways to prevent, deal with, or otherwise alleviate it. Causes of Burnout \u00b6 Your group may be growing faster than anticipated. Your passion for the community comes with an inability to say no when asked to do things. It\u2019s exhausting to be \u201con\u201d for so long \u2013 from the preparation leading up to an event, to organizing and interacting with all the people who come to the event, to following up with folks afterward. Signs of burnout \u00b6 You begin dropping the ball here and there because you\u2019ve overcommitted to things. You begin to dread planning or attending events. Relationships between organizers deteriorate. Your initial feeling of goodwill toward attendees begins to sour. Ways to prevent burnout \u00b6 Running your Group \u00b6 Find co-organizers to help shoulder the burden. We all have different skills, strengths, and weaknesses. Ask participants to be mentors to beginners. Even beginners can step up to deal with non-technical aspects of an event. This can also make things more fun, and helps build community. If people demand even more of you than what they\u2019re getting, politely remind them that we don\u2019t get paid for this, and that organizers lead very busy lives. Suggest that person step up and organize something themselves. Scale back your involvement to a level you find sustainable over the long term. Take a break altogether. Taking a break \u00b6 It\u2019s completely okay to stop your involvement for a time. Everyone would prefer that you take a breather if it meant you could come back refreshed and ready to pick things up again. Events \u00b6 Have variety! Try different speakers, different topics, different venues. Intersperse large events with simpler, informal ones. Lightning talks help break things up. Work with other groups in your community, ask them to lend a hand with things from time to time. Coping with burnout \u00b6 If you notice someone seems to be burning out \u00b6 Meet with them, outside of an official event, in a relaxed environment. Learn how they are feeling, work with them to determine how to deal with it if they are burning out. Let them take a breather and leave them the option to leave permanently without guilt. If you are feeling burnt out \u00b6 Know that you are not alone. This stuff is hard, and it\u2019s hard to do for a long time. It\u2019s ok to ask people to step up and help more. Reach out to other community organizers. Again: It\u2019s ok to take a break. Why are you here? \u00b6 Think about your personal goals and how your work is helping you achieve them. Also think about how your goals might be better achieved if, in the long term, you managed to avoid burning out. It\u2019s really rewarding to help others both learn Python and find their place in the larger community, but it\u2019s really hard work. There\u2019s more support in your group than you might guess. People will want to help you out if they can. Summary \u00b6 Self care is important, perhaps most important . In particular, in times of stress, illness, or sleep-deprivation, remember to take the time to show compassion and care for yourself. People are human. We all get sick, overwhelmed, forgetful, and make mistakes at times. Try to remember and embrace these as the \u201coh, goodness\u201d moments of volunteering. \"Hello, Murphy. Welcome.\" Murphy\u2019s Law (Source: Wikipedia. an adage or epigram that is typically stated as: Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.) pops up in the most unexpected times and places.

If you would like to announce a Python related event, please see Submitting an event to the Python events calendars . Event Hosting \u00b6 Websites \u00b6 Email \u00b6 We recommend that all Python software communities have their own general email address (e.g. pythonghana.org). You and your other co-organizers can manage that email address how you'd like (e.g. all co-organizers can log in; all email is forwarded; only one organizer manages it; etc).

Account & Password Management \u00b6 Please sign up for all accounts related to your Python software community with your designated email address. This is so that handover to a future organizer is a lot smoother, and account recovery is easier. We highly suggest you use a unique password for each account you use. An example is LastPass , a password manager (so you don't have to remember every unique password) that allows you to create unique and difficult-to-guess passwords, as well as save them for you. LastPass also allows you to share passwords with folks; so you can set up your local Python community Facebook account, then store that password in LastPass , and allow your co-organizers to log in with that stored password by sharing it.

There's no hard requirements or one \"correct\" way to organize an event. But planning ahead can improve your event and your experience as an organizer. In-person events help build community. There are many types of events you can organize, and they don't need to be complicated or \"perfect\" to be effective. You don't need a lot of people for an event to be a success, usually communities and events start little and they grow organically. Some examples of events are: Community Meetups : Casual gatherings for networking, sharing updates, and brainstorming. Talk Nights / Lightning Talks : Community members share knowledge in short talks (5\u201320 min). Coffee Chats / Open Hours : Regular informal virtual/in-person hangouts. Workshops : Hands-on sessions (e.g., intro to Git, testing frameworks, contributing to OSS). Study Groups : Regular meetups to learn a tool, framework, or language together. Coworking sessions: Meet in a local coffee store or somewhere similar to work. Organizing an event isn't necessarily complicated, but it can take time\u2014so having a checklist is helpful, especially to divide tasks. Example Checklist for an In-Person Meetup with Talks \u00b6 Set the date and time (Find the day of the week that works best for your community). Find a venue \u2014 local tech companies or universities can sometimes host the event. Call for talks \u2014 ask in tech groups, via DM, etc. Be persistent \u2014 follow up and reconfirm talks, workshops, or other activities. Create the event on meetup.com ; you can duplicate a previous event. Make a flyer (you can reuse designs from past events or use canva.com ): Logo Date Time Venue Talks, workshops, activities Meetup event link Post on social media (include both the flyer and event details).

Don't include them in your events unless the costs are easily covered, such as through a sponsor. Celebrate small wins. Thank volunteers and speakers, and highlight what went well. It encourages more people to get involved next time. Keep a list of venues where you've hosted events, along with the contact person. This can be useful for planning future events or if someone else needs to organize the next one. Take pictures! Keeping memories is great and you can use the pictures to promote future events. Just make sure you have permission from the people in the photos before sharing them publicly. Invite attendees to give a talk at the next event or to help organize it. Ask for feedback on what you could improve for the next event. Start and end with community. Give time before/after the event for people to talk. Community often grows in the gaps between the scheduled activities. Document everything.

The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is a non-profit membership organization devoted to advancing open source technology related to the Python programming language. It qualifies under the US Internal Revenue Code as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) scientific and educational public charity, and conducts its business according to the rules for such organizations. The PSF: Produces the core Python distribution, made available to the public free of charge. This includes the Python language itself, its standard libraries and documentation, installers, source code, educational materials, and assorted tools and applications. Establishes PSF licenses, ensuring the rights of the public to freely obtain, use, redistribute, and modify intellectual property held by the PSF. Works with the Open Source Initiative to ensure that PSF licenses conform to the Open Source Definition. Holds Python's intellectual property rights for releases 2.1 and following. Seeks to obtain the intellectual property rights for Python releases prior to 2.1, for relicensing under the PSF Python license, to relieve the legal burden on Python's users. The PSF may also seek rights to other Python-related software for relicensing under a PSF license. Protects the Python name, and the names, service marks and trademarks associated with all other intellectual property held by the PSF. Solicits and manages contributions to the Python codebase, and may perform these services on behalf of other open source Python-related codebases. Raises funds to support PSF programs and services. The regulations for public charity funding are complex. Some consequences are that the vast bulk of funding must come from private contributions (including sponsoring memberships) and public grants, must come from a broad base, and that no single private donor can supply a substantial percentage of the PSF's total funding. Additional revenue may be pursued in ways consistent with then-current rules for public charities and with Python's standing as an open source project. For example, the PSF may offer to sell conference proceedings, special Python distributions, or merchandise with distinctive insignia. Publicizes, promotes the adoption of, and facilitates the ongoing development of Python-related technology and educational resources. This includes, but is not limited to, maintaining a public web site, planning Python conferences, and offering grants to Python-related open source projects. Encourages and facilitates Python-related research in the public interest. \"Open source\" is defined as: freely available technology licensed under terms compatible with Version 1.9 (or later) of the Open Source Definition, as established by the Open Source Initiative (see http://www.opensource.org/ ). Creating & Enforcing a Code of Conduct \u00b6 The Python community thrives on diversity, mutual respect, and the shared goal of growing as a welcoming space. To uphold these values, any individual or group organizing Python events or meetups should have in place a Code of Conduct. While the Python Software Foundation has their own Code of Conduct , it is the responsibility of each independent event, group, or online community to create and enforce their own policy. Think of the Code of Conduct as documentation: taking implicit expectations about behavior and making them explicit. Choosing a Code of Conduct \u00b6 Adopting the PSF Code of Conduct \u00b6 A common practice for many global event and community organizers is to adopt the Python Software Foundation Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct is an excellent foundation for global communities because it sets clear, inclusive standards that welcome everyone, safeguard against harassment, and offers consistent guidelines for participation. It can be tweaked to individual community needs, whilst still upholding the core Python community standards. Recommendation: For the PSF Code of Conduct to work efficiently, it is recommended that an independent Code of Conduct team be established to uphold effective communication with any issues amongst the community as well as providing non-biased support separate to the organizers. Creating Your Own Code of Conduct \u00b6 Creating your own code of conduct is one of the best ways to ensure that your event or community reflects your local culture and customs, while still upholding the global Python community values. A well-crafted Code of Conduct sets expectations for behavior, helps prevent harassment or exclusion, and provides a transparent process for reporting and addressing issues. While there is no universal code that fits every situation, you can start with proven templates and adapt them. You may use this Community Code of Conduct Template , which covers essential elements such as: Clear Scope \u2013 who and what activities the code applies to. Community Standards \u2013 outlines the gold standard for all members, organizers and anyone else associated with the community. Ensuring that the standard reflects the Python Software Foundation's Diversity Initiatives . Anti-harassment & Inclusion Provisions Expected & Unacceptable Behavior Reporting Process Enforcement Procedures You are encouraged to tailor this template to reflect your group's size, context, and specific priorities. Common Reporting Mechanisms \u00b6 Tips & Best Practices \u00b6 Ensure that you keep your Code of Conduct visible. Posting your code of conduct publicly, and reminding participants of it throughout your event or group's activities, creates a safer and more welcoming environment for everyone. Responding to CoC Violations \u00b6 If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the PSF Code of Conduct Working Group may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community and community events with no refund of event tickets. The full list of consequences for inappropriate behavior is listed in the Enforcement Procedures . If you believe that someone is violating the Python Code of Conduct, or have any other concerns, please contact the Python Software Foundation Code of Conduct Working Group immediately. They can be reached by emailing conduct-wg@python.org Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for everyone. PSF Trademark Usage Policy \u00b6 \"Python\" is a registered trademark of the PSF, as well as \"PyCon\" and \"PyLadies\". The Python logos (in several variants) use trademarks of the PSF as well.

PSF PyCon Trademark Usage Policy \u00b6 In order to protect the term \"PyCon\" against unwanted or misleading use by third parties, the PSF claims the term \"PyCon\" as a trademark worldwide for conference activities.

The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is a non-profit membership organization devoted to advancing open source technology related to the Python programming language. It qualifies under the US Internal Revenue Code as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) scientific and educational public charity, and conducts its business according to the rules for such organizations. The PSF: Produces the core Python distribution, made available to the public free of charge. This includes the Python language itself, its standard libraries and documentation, installers, source code, educational materials, and assorted tools and applications. Establishes PSF licenses, ensuring the rights of the public to freely obtain, use, redistribute, and modify intellectual property held by the PSF. Works with the Open Source Initiative to ensure that PSF licenses conform to the Open Source Definition. Holds Python's intellectual property rights for releases 2.1 and following. Seeks to obtain the intellectual property rights for Python releases prior to 2.1, for relicensing under the PSF Python license, to relieve the legal burden on Python's users. The PSF may also seek rights to other Python-related software for relicensing under a PSF license. Protects the Python name, and the names, service marks and trademarks associated with all other intellectual property held by the PSF. Solicits and manages contributions to the Python codebase, and may perform these services on behalf of other open source Python-related codebases. Raises funds to support PSF programs and services. The regulations for public charity funding are complex. Some consequences are that the vast bulk of funding must come from private contributions (including sponsoring memberships) and public grants, must come from a broad base, and that no single private donor can supply a substantial percentage of the PSF's total funding. Additional revenue may be pursued in ways consistent with then-current rules for public charities and with Python's standing as an open source project. For example, the PSF may offer to sell conference proceedings, special Python distributions, or merchandise with distinctive insignia. Publicizes, promotes the adoption of, and facilitates the ongoing development of Python-related technology and educational resources. This includes, but is not limited to, maintaining a public web site, planning Python conferences, and offering grants to Python-related open source projects. Encourages and facilitates Python-related research in the public interest. \"Open source\" is defined as: freely available technology licensed under terms compatible with Version 1.9 (or later) of the Open Source Definition, as established by the Open Source Initiative (see http://www.opensource.org/ ).","title":"Understanding the Python Software Foundation's Mission and Governance"},{"location":"governance/#creating-enforcing-a-code-of-conduct","text":"The Python community thrives on diversity, mutual respect, and the shared goal of growing as a welcoming space.

We're excited to have people like you join our growing community and want to help you get your group launched as quickly and smoothly as possible. If our experience is any indication, your first major event will galvanize and inspire the Python community in your area and create momentum for subsequent events, so it's crucial to start things off on the right foot! To help you get started, we've created this open source kit for starting your own Python software community in your region. Guidelines for Starting Your Community \u00b6 When you start your own Python Software Community, you'll be helping to build and grow a local Python community, through meetups, or sharing info through mailing lists, social media, etc. A Python software community is not meant for a one-time event or workshop. We encourage ongoing community activities through your group, at least once or twice a year. Some of our groups are aiming for monthly events. Ideally, the organizers in your group should be anyone who is enthusiastic about bringing people together to learn, share knowledge and contribute to the spreading of the use of the Python programming language. We also suggest at least two co-organizers in your group to help share the workload and prevent burnout from any single organizer. When starting a chapter, we recommend that you check if a community already exists. Check Local User Groups Worldwide to find if there is already a group in your area. If there is no Python user group in your area, this is probably your cue to start one. If it already exists and is dormant, check the Reviving a Dormant Community section in this kit to learn about how you can help revive the group.
