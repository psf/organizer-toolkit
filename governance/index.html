<p>The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/diversity/">diverse</a> and international community of Python programmers.</p>
<p>The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is a non-profit membership organization devoted to advancing open source technology related to the Python programming language. It qualifies under the US Internal Revenue Code as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) scientific and educational public charity, and conducts its business according to the rules for such organizations.</p>
<p>The PSF:</p>
<ul>
<li>Produces the core Python distribution, made available to the public free of charge. This includes the Python language itself, its standard libraries and documentation, installers, source code, educational materials, and assorted tools and applications.</li>
<li>Establishes PSF licenses, ensuring the rights of the public to freely obtain, use, redistribute, and modify intellectual property held by the PSF.</li>
<li>Works with the Open Source Initiative to ensure that PSF licenses conform to the Open Source Definition.</li>
<li>Holds Python's intellectual property rights for releases 2.1 and following.</li>
<li>Seeks to obtain the intellectual property rights for Python releases prior to 2.1, for relicensing under the PSF Python license, to relieve the legal burden on Python's users. The PSF may also seek rights to other Python-related software for relicensing under a PSF license.</li>
<li>Protects the Python name, and the names, service marks and trademarks associated with all other intellectual property held by the PSF.</li>
<li>Solicits and manages contributions to the Python codebase, and may perform these services on behalf of other open source Python-related codebases.</li>
<li>Raises funds to support PSF programs and services. The regulations for public charity funding are complex. Some consequences are that the vast bulk of funding must come from private contributions (including sponsoring memberships) and public grants, must come from a broad base, and that no single private donor can supply a substantial percentage of the PSF's total funding. Additional revenue may be pursued in ways consistent with then-current rules for public charities and with Python's standing as an open source project. For example, the PSF may offer to sell conference proceedings, special Python distributions, or merchandise with distinctive insignia.</li>
<li>Publicizes, promotes the adoption of, and facilitates the ongoing development of Python-related technology and educational resources. This includes, but is not limited to, maintaining a public web site, planning Python conferences, and offering grants to Python-related open source projects.</li>
<li>Encourages and facilitates Python-related research in the public interest.</li>
</ul>
<p>"Open source" is defined as: freely available technology licensed under terms compatible with Version 1.9 (or later) of the Open Source Definition, as established by the Open Source Initiative (see <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">http://www.opensource.org/</a>).</p>
<h2 id="creating-enforcing-a-code-of-conduct">Creating &amp; Enforcing a Code of Conduct<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-enforcing-a-code-of-conduct" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The Python community thrives on diversity, mutual respect, and the shared goal of growing as a welcoming space. To uphold these values, any individual or group organizing Python events or meetups should have in place a Code of Conduct. While the Python Software Foundation has their own <a href="https://policies.python.org/python.org/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>, it is the responsibility of each independent event, group, or online community to create and enforce their own policy. Think of the Code of Conduct as documentation: taking implicit expectations about behavior and making them explicit.</p>
<h3 id="choosing-a-code-of-conduct">Choosing a Code of Conduct<a class="headerlink" href="#choosing-a-code-of-conduct" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<h4 id="adopting-the-psf-code-of-conduct">Adopting the PSF Code of Conduct<a class="headerlink" href="#adopting-the-psf-code-of-conduct" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>A common practice for many global event and community organizers is to adopt the Python Software Foundation Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct is an excellent foundation for global communities because it sets clear, inclusive standards that welcome everyone, safeguard against harassment, and offers consistent guidelines for participation. It can be tweaked to individual community needs, whilst still upholding the core Python community standards.</p>
<p><em>Recommendation: For the PSF Code of Conduct to work efficiently, it is recommended that an independent Code of Conduct team be established to uphold effective communication with any issues amongst the community as well as providing non-biased support separate to the organizers.</em></p>
<h4 id="creating-your-own-code-of-conduct">Creating Your Own Code of Conduct<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-your-own-code-of-conduct" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Creating your own code of conduct is one of the best ways to ensure that your event or community reflects your local culture and customs, while still upholding the global Python community values. A well-crafted Code of Conduct sets expectations for behavior, helps prevent harassment or exclusion, and provides a transparent process for reporting and addressing issues.</p>
<p>While there is no universal code that fits every situation, you can start with proven templates and adapt them. You may use this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TYoAfZxZiXveDSSRZXHBk-DzBIzAXDvDQ8lUU1ejXi4/edit?usp=sharing">Community Code of Conduct Template</a>, which covers essential elements such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Clear Scope</em> – who and what activities the code applies to.</li>
<li><em>Community Standards</em> – outlines the gold standard for all members, organizers and anyone else associated with the community. Ensuring that the standard reflects the Python Software Foundation's <a href="https://www.python.org/community/diversity/">Diversity Initiatives</a>.</li>
<li><em>Anti-harassment &amp; Inclusion Provisions</em></li>
<li><em>Expected &amp; Unacceptable Behavior</em></li>
<li><em>Reporting Process</em></li>
<li><em>Enforcement Procedures</em></li>
</ul>
<p>You are encouraged to tailor this template to reflect your group's size, context, and specific priorities.</p>

<li>Ensure that you keep your Code of Conduct visible. Posting your code of conduct publicly, and reminding participants of it throughout your event or group's activities, creates a safer and more welcoming environment for everyone.</li>

<h2 id="responding-to-coc-violations">Responding to CoC Violations<a class="headerlink" href="#responding-to-coc-violations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the <a href="https://wiki.python.org/psf/ConductWG/Charter">PSF Code of Conduct Working Group</a> may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community and community events with no refund of event tickets. The full list of consequences for inappropriate behavior is listed in the <a href="https://policies.python.org/python.org/code-of-conduct/Enforcement-Procedures/">Enforcement Procedures</a>.</p>
<p>If you believe that someone is violating the Python Code of Conduct, or have any other concerns, please contact the Python Software Foundation Code of Conduct Working Group immediately. They can be reached by emailing conduct-wg@python.org</p>
<p>Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for everyone.</p>
